1. [Forest CoverType dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.ehttps://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Crop+mapping+using+fused+optical-radar+data+set du/ml/datasets/covertype)

2. [3D road network with highly accurate elevation information (+-20cm) from Denmark used in eco-routing and fuel/Co2-estimation routing algorithms](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/3D+Road+Network+(North+Jutland,+Denmark))

3. [Combining optical and PolSAR remote sensing images offers a complementary data set with a significant number of temporal, spectral, textural, and polarimetric features for cropland classification ](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Crop+mapping+using+fused+optical-radar+data+set)

4. [The dataset is a multilabel classification problem. The goal is to predict the presence of amphibians species near the water reservoirs based on features obtained from GIS systems and satellite images ](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Amphibians)

5. [Multi-spectral values of pixels in 3x3 neighbourhoods in a satellite image, and the classification associated with the central pixel in each neighbourhood ](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Statlog+(Landsat+Satellite))
